# ParkingLot

This is an implementation of an Object oriented design for a Parking lot.
It has been envisioned as being a web app which would allow the users to booking the parking spaces online.

It is an ongoing project which has some basic implementation ready to be consumed. UI work still needs to be started.
Some unit tests are still pending. I will try to keep this file up to date.

Build the changes by running : mvn package
For running unit test: mvn test
